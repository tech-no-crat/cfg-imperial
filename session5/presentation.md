# HTML

# What is HTML?
* The standard markup language to define how webpages look, initially released in 1993.
* A webpage is made up of HTML tags, for example:
  * `<h1>CubeSat</h1>` - Header (title)
  * `<img src='images/tesla.jpg' alt='Tesla Model S' />` - an image
  * `<a href='https://cubesat.ic.ac.uk'>Imperial Cubesat</a>` - a link
  * `<p> <a href='http://google.com/'>Best search engine</a></p>` A link within a paragraph. An HTML tag can contain other HTML tags inside it, said to be its "children".
* Good HTML is **semantic** (reinforces the meaning of the information), but does not describe how the webpage will look.

  <!DOCTYPE html>

      <h1>This is an example HTML page</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <span class='acronym'>HTML</span> is <em>wonderful</em>.
      Here's a link to <a href='https://google.com'>google</a>
